# Atlas Web Back End

This is the primary repository for T3 Full-Stack Web Development projects
for back end projects, and potentially other future projects in T4 and T5.

Back end web development is development of a website's functionality. It
includes things like scripts and the web server. To my knowledge, the most
common languages used for back end scripts are JavaScript and TypeScript. This
repo focuses on JavaScript.
