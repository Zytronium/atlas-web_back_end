# Python - Async

---

Async refers to asynchronous functions in Python. Async functions are
used when they may take time to run and need the rest of the code to
wait for it to finish before continuing. For example, when you load
data from an API, it takes time to fetch that data from the internet.
Your code needs to wait for that fetch to complete before continuing.
