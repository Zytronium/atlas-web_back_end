# Python - Async

---

Async refers to asynchronous functions in Python. Async functions run
separately from the rest of the code, allowing the program to continue
running while the async function runs, which helps in situations where
a function might take a while to run, but the rest of the code doesn't
have to wait on it. For example, when you load data from an API, it 
takes time to fetch that data from the internet. Your code needs to wait
for that fetch to complete before continuing.

Note: I completely mixed up two different concepts here on accident and
need to go back and correct it.
