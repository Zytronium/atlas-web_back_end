# Unittests in JS

---

This project is all about unittests in JavaScript. and covers more unittesting
with packages like mocha, chai, and sinon. It also covers unittesting with 
a locally running express server. It covers how to set stubs (basically mocks),
set spies (checks for things like function calls), skip tests without removing
them, async testing, and more.
