# Python - Async Comprehension

---

This project covers async comprehension, and async generators.
Async comprehensions allow different things to execute at the same time,
generally saving time at the cost of using more resources. Generators
can run asynchronously and can return a value mid-loop, pause, and resume
the loop the next time it's called.
