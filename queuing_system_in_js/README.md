# Queueing System in JS

This project is about using Kue to create job queues in JavaScript. A queueing
system allows you to queue up jobs to be performed by the server. This project
links a Redis server to a queuing system to simulate sending codes to phone numbers.
It also displays progress for each job and includes a phone number blacklist.
