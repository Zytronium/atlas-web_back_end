# Pagination

---

Pagination is when you divide a large amount of data into multiple pages in
order to save resources and user experience. This is especially necessary when
you have an incomprehensibly large set of data, like every video, playlist, and
channel on YouTube, or every post ever made on X/Twitter, or 150 million Google
search results. Websites like these require either a form of pagination (like
Google uses) or must load the data in sections as the user scrolls toward the
end of the currently loaded content (Like YouTube and X).

###### Note: to my knowledge, YouTube and X do not try to load everything ever posted on them, but theoretically, with no search query and no blocked content/users, they would load everything if you scrolled long enough.
